../Setups-public/
* Replaced MIDAS-F.R with version in from AstA_KPW_ConfData directory ../Setups directory
* Deleted TABLE_5_6.M replaced with TABLE_5_7.M from AstA_KPW_ConfData directory ../Setups directory
* Copy paste Process_data_MIDASF from AstA_KPW_ConfData directory ../Setups/Support-code/ directory to ../Setups-public/Support-code. Adjusted Estimation.R accordingly (such that it loads this function)

../dm
* Replaced DM_TEST.xlsx with outcomes in DM_M_greater_DFM from AstA_KPW_ConfData directory ../dm directory

../fcst
* fcst results MIDAS-F.xlsx with MIDAS-F.xlsx from AstA_KPW_ConfData directory ../fcst directory

../rmsfe
* replace RMSFE_M.xlsx and RMSFE_Q.xlsx with files from  from AstA_KPW_ConfData directory ../rmsfe directory


Adjustments:
* Adjusted ESTIMATION.R in line with adjustment in AstA_KPW_ConfData directory (mainly no longer direct to different data)
* Adjusted MIDAS-F.R such that it writes to Results_public instead of public, and writes to the right directories (fcsts, rmsfe)
* Adjusted output directories in TABLE_5_7.m
