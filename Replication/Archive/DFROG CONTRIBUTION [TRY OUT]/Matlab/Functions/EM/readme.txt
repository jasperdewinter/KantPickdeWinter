Various things left to be done

(1) functions 'replace' & 'eigen' are missing from Piotr

(2) Replace 'normX' with 'z01'

(3) Replace flamcal1 with OLS or even the simple equation

(4) replace 'rearrange', 'trim' and 'trimnanx' with their code
    They are just too simple
    But do so only after a few checks

(5) What about lag(x)? Could also simplify
