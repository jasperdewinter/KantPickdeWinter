Results produced in ..Archive\DFROG\main.m.
After you copy-paste these setups to ..\fcst you can run the model.
Exaclty the same results produced in DFROG ..\Replication\DFROG CONTRIBUTION\main.m but 
something went wrong with the size of the contribution matrix to write to file. 

So, I now re-run the whole thing using the R-Setups in ..\Dorinth\Production Code\Main_KPW.R. The projections are somewhat different (but might averag out), 
probably because you treat the variables a little bit differently...
