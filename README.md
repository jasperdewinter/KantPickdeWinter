# Nowcasting GDP using machine learning methods

This repository provides code to reproduce results in the paper "Nowcasting GDP using machine learning methods" by Dennis Kan, Andreas Pick and Jasper de Winter (2023).

The folder structure is as follows:

* The R-code to run all models and functions to create all outcomes and figures are all in the `Set-ups` folder.
* The resulting pdfs are in the `figures` folder.

This repository contains setups to reproduce the results in Kant. D, Pick, A. and J.M. de Winter (2022), Nowcasting GDP using machine learning methods, DNB Working Paper nr. 754, [here]( https://jasperdewinter.github.io/pp/files/working_paper_no_754.pdf)
